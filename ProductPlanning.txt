Login/Register feature
Prompt user to login or register (stretch, if a username is invalid ask if they would like to register)
accept user input for username
accept user input for password
authenticate user as Employee or Manager
(for now hardcode an employee and a manager to get login functionality)
maybe a menus class for menu options

	Class users
	create upon successfull login
	user id (id for db later)
	uername
	password
	user role (for permissions later)

	Class tickets
	ticket id
	amount
	description
	status
	user id (references user table)



### UserLogin ###

accept a username 
accept a password
validate credentials and create new User object of that user
	once db is set up get user_id, username, user_type for User object
	user_id wont be used yet but can be part for use after mvp is met
return User object





### Menus ###
Generate menu functionality with the correct choices for the login type
Employee:
	submit ticket
	view submitted tickets optional filter by status

Manager:
	process Pending tickets (approve or deny)
	view pending tickets
		(probably give option for specific ticket id and overload method for processing)





### Databases ###

CREATE TABLE users (
	user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
	"password" VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
	user_role VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'employee'
);

CREATE TABLE tickets (
	ticket_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	amount MONEY,
	description VARCHAR(800),
	status VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'pending',
	user_id INTEGER,
	CONSTRAINT tickets_users_fk FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (user_id)
);


## when fetching tickets for manager sselect only pending tickets
## should add date to tickets once mvp met
