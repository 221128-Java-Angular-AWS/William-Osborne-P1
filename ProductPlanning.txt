Login/Register feature
Prompt user to login or register (stretch, if a username is invalid ask if they would like to register)
accept user input for username
accept user input for password
authenticate user as Employee or Manager
(for now hardcode an employee and a manager to get login functionality)
maybe a menus class for menu options

	Class user
	create upon successfull login
	user id (id for db later)
	uername
	user type (for permissions later)





### UserLogin ###

accept a username 
accept a password
validate credentials and create new User object of that user
	once db is set up get user_id, username, user_type for User object
	user_id wont be used yet but can be part for use after mvp is met
return User object





### Menus ###
Generate menu functionality with the correct choices for the login type
Employee:
	submit ticket
	view submitted tickets optional filter by status

Manager:
	process Pending tickets (approve or deny)
	view pending tickets
		(probably give option for specific ticket id and overload method for processing)





### Databases ###

Table users:
user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
username VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
user_type VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT employee;

Table tickets:
ticket_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(user_id),
amount NUMERIC NOT NULL,
description VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
date NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
status VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'pending';

## status limited to pending, approved, denied
## no date option when submitting, just the current date (may change after mvp met)
## when fetching tickets for managersselect only pending tickets
