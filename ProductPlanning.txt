Login/Register feature
Prompt user to login or register (stretch, if a username is invalid ask if they would like to register)
accept user input for username
accept user input for password
authenticate user as Employee or Manager
(for now hardcode an employee and a manager to get login functionality)
maybe a menus class for menu options

	Class employee
	create the user for use in the session and associate with menus appropriate for the employee permissions
